# Creating the model to predict a client's eligibility for personal loans

The model was trained based on data from the `Bank_Personal_Loan_Modelling.csv` file. All steps of training are in the `model-training-steps.ipynb` file. The result was wrapped into a pickle file(`model.pkl`). 
The Flask app provides a web interface to calculate the probability for a client to receive personal loans.
